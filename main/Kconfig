		PM sensor starts sending results imediatelly after enabling it (set line), but due
		to its mechanical construction first results are not reliable due to insufficient
		air flow. We ignore samples sends during warm-up period (suggested values: 10-30 sec)
		and let its working conditions to stabilise.

config OAP_PM_MEAS_TIME
	int "PM sensor measurement time (sec)"
	default 30
	help
		Time of a single measurments including warm-up time. Samples collected during this period (after warm-up)
		are be used to compute average result.

	int "PM sensor sample buffer size"
	default 120
	help		
		Max number of samples that are stored during measurement period. PMSx003 sensor sends ~1 sample / sec.
		If more samples are collected during measurement, older samples get overriden.
		
config OAP_RESULT_BUFFER_SIZE
	int "measurements buffer size"
	default 1
	help		
		Buffer for data that cannot be immediately published because sensor is offline.
		For some services that can accept only real-time data, this should be set to 1.
